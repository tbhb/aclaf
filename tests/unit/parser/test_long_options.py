"""Placeholder module for long-option specific tests.

Common behavior tests have been moved to test_options.py.

This file is retained for potential future long-option-specific tests.
If/when long-option-specific behaviors are identified that differ from
short options, tests should be added here.

Currently, no long-option-specific tests exist - all option behavior is
consistent between --option and -o forms and is tested via parametrized
tests in test_options.py.
