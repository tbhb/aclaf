"""Security-focused tests for the Aclaf parser.

This package contains tests that verify the parser's resistance to:
- Command injection attacks
- Input validation vulnerabilities
- Resource exhaustion (DoS) attacks
- Unicode and encoding attacks
- Edge cases with security implications

All tests are marked with @pytest.mark.security for selective execution.
