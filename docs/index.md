# What is Aclaf?

Aclaf is a command-line application framework for building CLI programs in Python that brings modern development practices to CLI development. It's the tool for developers who want fast, type-safe CLI applications that deliver polished, accessible experiences to end users without fighting the framework.

Aclaf leverages modern Python capabilities to rethink what's possible in a CLI framework. By controlling the entire stack from argument parsing to terminal output, the framework delivers a vertically integrated solution where everything fits together naturally. It's inspired by popular CLI frameworks like [Cyclopts](https://cyclopts.readthedocs.io/) and [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and type-based modeling and validation frameworks like [Pydantic](https//docs.pydantic.dev). Type-annotated functions become commands without extensive decoration and type conversion happens automatically based on signatures. Terminal output adapts to capabilities while maintaining accessibility. Developer experience, end-user experience, and accessibility are all first-class concerns built into every component from the start, not as afterthoughts.

Aclaf is currently in early development and actively evolving. The parser is feature-complete and serves as the foundation for all other capabilities. Commands, routing, type conversion, validation, console output, error handling, testing utilities, and shell completion are in active development. This means the framework is nascent, breaking changes happen frequently to improve the design, and nothing represents a commitment or promise. But it also means there's an opportunity to take a fresh approach to CLI development that prioritizes the things that matter: quality code, great developer experience, and accessible, polished tools for end users.

If you're a Python developer building command-line tools and frustrated with existing solutions, Aclaf might be what you're looking for once it's released. Explore the vision to understand the principles guiding development and check the roadmap to see current priorities and progress.
